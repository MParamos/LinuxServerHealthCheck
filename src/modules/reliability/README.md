- **Author:** [Miguel Páramos](https://www.miguelparamos.com)

## Description
Tracks the system's vital lifecycle events. It reports the current uptime, exact boot time, and the timestamp of the last proper shutdown. It also implements heuristic checks to detect unexpected power losses or system crashes.

## Verification
**Why this is a valid LinuxServerHealthCheck module:**
This module strictly adheres to the architecture of LinuxServerHealthCheck. It provides the required `module.sh` to extract the data, a `template.html` for presentation, and isolated SQL/collection scripts when necessary. It respects the decentralized design, ensuring it can be dynamically loaded or cleanly uninstalled without affecting the core system.
